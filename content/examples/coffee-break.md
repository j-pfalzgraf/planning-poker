> **Action:** Discussion or break

---

## When is "☕" Used?

The coffee cup card has various meanings in Planning Poker:

### 1. Break Needed

The team signals that a break is needed – whether physical or mental.

### 2. Discussion Required

The story was not understood or clarification is needed before estimation.

### 3. Abstention

A team member abstains from the estimate (e.g., because they won't work on the feature).

### 4. Story is Not a Story

What's being estimated is not a real user story and should be handled differently.
