# ? Story Points – Unknown Effort

> **Effort:** Cannot be estimated
> **Risk:** Unknown
> **Action:** Spike/Research required

---

## When is "?" Used?

The "?" card signals that a story **cannot be estimated** because:

- Requirements are unclear
- Technical feasibility is uncertain
- Too many unknowns exist
- More context is needed

---

## Example 1: Unclear Requirements

**Title:** Data Import from Legacy System

**Description:**
Data from the old system should be imported.

**Why "?":**

- What format is the data in?
- How many records?
- Which fields are mapped?
- Are there validation rules?

**Next Step:**
Meeting with stakeholder to clarify requirements.

## Example 2: Technical Uncertainty

**Title:** Integration with Third-Party API

**Description:**
Connect to vendor XY's API.

**Why "?":**

- API documentation not reviewed
- Authentication method unclear
- Rate limits unknown
- Sandbox access missing

**Next Step:**
Spike: Review API documentation, test sandbox.

---

## Example 3: Feasibility Question

**Title:** Search Performance Optimization

**Description:**
The search should be faster.

**Why "?":**

- Current performance not measured
- Goal not defined (how fast?)
- Root cause of problem unknown

**Next Step:**
Perform performance analysis, gather metrics.

## Recommended Approach

1. **Defer the story** – Don't add to the sprint
2. **Plan a spike** – Timeboxed research (e.g., 4h, 1 day)
3. **Document findings** – Record insights
4. **Re-estimate the story** – Estimate again with new knowledge
5. **Possibly split** – Break into smaller, estimable stories

## ⚠️ Note

"?" is **not a valid estimate** for the sprint.
It's a signal to the team that **upfront work is needed**.
